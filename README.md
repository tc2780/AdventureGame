# A Small Game 
(name not completely set yet)

## About the Game:
This application is a game where the user is stuck in a forest and must make it out by both
raising their progress to 100% and keeping their health above 0%. While on the way out, the user 
will encounter different obstacles, where they will be presented with different options to choose from, and be
able to open their inventory to use an object.
Each option will either result in an increase/decrease in progress and/or health. At least one option will result in
a treasure chest, where the user will be able to pick up to 1 object to add to their inventory. The object will
be able to be used in the next obstacle. Inventory only has 3 spaces total.
Progress will never be able to reach below 0, but if health is ever <= 0, the user loses. 

Between each obstacle, the user should be able to:
- view current progress
- view journey log
- view inventory
- view current health
- continue on journey
- or quit

## Why it's of interest to me and who will use it:
One reason why this project is of interest to me is that I've always found playing small games like this fun,
and good way for me to de-stress after a long day. Also, not only will I enjoy creating the different
obstacles, the options, and all the possible results, I'm also looking forward to making this a graphical application.
I've never really done anything like this before, and being able to play around with the different elements of the game
while trying to make it look nice, will most likely be challenging, yet rewarding.

The main purpose of this game is to provide a small distraction from other things in life, and so, the target
audience is anyone who would like to take some time off and play a small game that will hopefully leave them 
feeling better than before.

## User stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add an object to the inventory
- As a user, I want to be able to name my character, and choose a possible design for them
- As a user, I want to be able to view my current progress and health
- As a user, I want to be able to view my inventory, and see an object's specifications
